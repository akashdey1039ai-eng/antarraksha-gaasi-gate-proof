# GAASI Adoption & Claims Standard — v1 (Locked)

GAASI — Global Autonomous Agent Survivability Index  
This document defines how GAASI adoption may be claimed, signaled, and verified.

---

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines the **only valid ways** an entity may claim
association, adoption, or compliance with GAASI v1.

GAASI compliance is **verifiable or invalid** — there is no implied adoption.

---

## 2. Eligible Claimants

The following entities may claim GAASI adoption:

- Autonomous AI agents
- Platforms deploying autonomous agents
- Organizations enforcing GAASI pre-deployment
- CI/CD pipelines integrating GAASI as a gate

Individuals MAY NOT claim GAASI compliance on behalf of systems.

---

## 3. Valid Adoption Conditions

An entity may claim GAASI adoption ONLY if:

- GAASI v1 is enforced **pre-deployment**
- GAASI verdicts are **binding**
- BLOCKED verdicts halt deployment
- Evidence hashes are retained for audit

Partial, advisory, or optional usage does NOT qualify.

---

## 4. Permitted Claims

Valid claims include:

- “This agent is evaluated under GAASI v1”
- “This deployment pipeline enforces GAASI v1”
- “This platform blocks agents that fail GAASI”

Claims MUST specify:
- GAASI version (v1)

---

## 5. Forbidden Claims

The following claims are explicitly forbidden:

- “GAASI-inspired”
- “GAASI-compatible”
- “GAASI-aligned”
- “GAASI-recommended”
- “GAASI-certified” (unless certificate issued)

Only **verifiable enforcement** constitutes adoption.

---

## 6. Evidence Requirement

Any GAASI adoption claim MUST be supportable by:

- a GAASI verdict
- a corresponding evidence hash
- a verifiable GAASI v1 evaluation

Claims without evidence are invalid.

---

## 7. Misrepresentation

Any entity making false or unverifiable GAASI claims:

- is considered non-compliant
- forfeits the right to reference GAASI
- invalidates all claimed evaluations

GAASI does not tolerate brand or standard dilution.

---

## 8. Public Verifiability

GAASI adoption claims are designed to be:

- independently verifiable
- machine-checkable
- audit-ready

Trust is not assumed.

---

## 9. Version Lock

This adoption and claims standard applies to **GAASI v1 (Locked)**.

Any change to:
- adoption criteria
- claim language
- verification requirements

requires:
- GAASI v2
- explicit public documentation
